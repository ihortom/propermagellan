### A Responsive WordPress theme based on "Foundation" front-end framework

An attempt to create a responsive WordPress theme for a simple one-page web site
 with a fixed menu bar with the menu items referencing various sections of the page. 
Each section, in fact, would be an individual WordPress page.

The theme is to serve as a framework to more advanced and customised themes for 
one-page designed web sites.

Depends on [**Foundation**](http://foundation.zurb.com/) CSS/Javascript framework by Zurb.

Uses [**Sass**](http://sass-lang.com/) to generate and compile custom style sheets.
